# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue: Class Name Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Tailwind CSS applications.  Incorrect class name concatenation or even minor typos can prevent styles from being applied correctly.  This leads to unexpected visual discrepancies in the UI.

## Bug Description
The bug arises from either:

1. **Typos:** A simple typo in a class name (e.g., `text-3xl` becomes `text-3xlx`) will prevent the style from working.
2. **Incorrect Concatenation:**  Improperly combining class names using string concatenation can lead to unpredictable results if whitespace or extra characters are introduced.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
3. Open `bug.jsx` to see the code with the bug.
4. Notice how the styling isn't applied correctly due to the class name issue.
5. Then look at `bugSolution.jsx` for the fix.

## Solution
Ensure that all Tailwind CSS class names are perfectly accurate.  Use proper string interpolation or template literals for class name concatenation to avoid introducing unwanted spaces or characters.
